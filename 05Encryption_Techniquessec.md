# Encryption Techniques
## Learning Objectives
- Understand cryptography basics
- Differentiate between symmetric and symmetric encryption
- Learn hashing and digital signature concepts
## Cryptography
Cryptography is a technique of securing information and communication using codes to ensure confidentiality, integrity and authentication.
## symmetric Encryption
- Uses two keys: Public key (for encryption) & Private key (for descryption).
- used for secure key exchange and digital communication.
## Hashing
- Converts data into a fixed-length string.
- One-way process - cannot be reveresed.
- Used for password storage aand integrity checking.
- Common Algorithms: SHA-256, MDS (deprecated)
## Digital Signature and certificates
- Ensure authentically and non-repudiation.
- A digital signature uses private key to sign data and public key to verify.
- Certicates (X.509) are issued Certificate Authorities (CAs) for trust verificationn(usedin HTTPS).
## Example:
When visiting  https://bank.com
- browser verifies certificate signed by CA to ensure authenticity.
