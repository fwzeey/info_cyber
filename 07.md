# Internet of things(IOT) Security 
## Iot Architecture Overview 

### Layers:
- Perception (sensors, Actuators)
- Network (Routers, Gateways, Protocols)
- Apllication (smart home, Healthcare, Industrial Iot)

- Communication Protocols: MQTT, COAP, ZigBee, BLE

### Common IoT Vulnerabilities
- Default or hardcoded credeentials (e.g., admin:admin)
- Unencrypted communication
- Weak authentication mechanisms
- Insecure firmware updates
- Lack of device patcing
- Exposure of LoT endpoints to the internet (Shodan indexing)

#IoT Attacks (Case Studies)
- Mirai Botnet (2016): DDoS attack using vulnerable IoT devices
- Ring Doorbell Data Leak: Unencrypted video feed
- Smart car Hacks: Remote control vulnerabilities in connected vehicles

## IoT Security Frameworks & Standards 
- Open Worldwide Apllication Security Project (OWASP) IoT Top 10
- IoT Security Foundation (IoTSF) Compliance Capabilities
- NISTIR 8259 - Device Cybersecurity Capabilties
- ENISA Guidelines for IoT risk managment

### IoT Security Measures
- Network segmentation for IoT devices
